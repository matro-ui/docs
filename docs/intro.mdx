# Getting Started


## Step 1: Installation


To use Matro UI in your project, run one of the following commands in your terminal:

<div className={s.tabs + " " + s.tabs_ic}>
<Tabs>
 <TabItem value="pnm" label="npm" attributes={{className: s.npm}}>
```bash
npm install matro-ui
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn" attributes={{className: s.yarn}}>
```bash
yarn add matro-ui
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="pnpm" label="pnpm" attributes={{className: s.pnpm}}>
```bash
pnpm add matro-ui
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="bun" label="bun" attributes={{className: s.bun}}>
```bash
bun add matro-ui
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
</div>

After installing Matra UI, no further actions are required. By design, we decided not to overload Matra with Context Providers and other "heavy" things. However, this may change in the future.

## Step 2: Add your first Component

Here's a quick example of how you can do it using something like Create React App:

```js
import React from "react";
import * as ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { Button } from "matro-ui";
 
ReactDOM.render(
  <Button>This button looks great.</Button>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```
