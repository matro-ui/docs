# Getting Started


## Step 1: Installation


To use Matro UI in your project, run one of the following commands in your terminal:

<div className={s.tabs + " " + s.tabs_ic}>
<Tabs className={s.parent}>
 <TabItem value="pnm" label="npm" attributes={{className: [s.item, s.npm]}}>
```bash
npm install matro-ui
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn" attributes={{className: [s.item, s.yarn]}}>
```bash
yarn add matro-ui
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="pnpm" label="pnpm" attributes={{className: [s.item, s.pnpm]}}>
```bash
pnpm add matro-ui
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="bun" label="bun" attributes={{className: [s.item, s.bun]}}>
```bash
bun add matro-ui
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
</div>

After installing Matra UI, no further actions are required. Currently, we do not use the Context Provider for custom theme settings. However, this will change in the near future.

## Step 2: Add your first Component

Here's a quick example of how you can do it using something like <a href="https://create-react-app.dev/" target="_blank">Create React App</a>:

```js
import React from "react";
import * as ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { Button } from "matro-ui";
 
ReactDOM.render(
  <Button>This button looks great.</Button>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```
